# Golden Ratio

HackBenchers is a series of beginner-level hacks exclusively for school students and undergraduates to leverage their scope of improvement in science and technology. HackBenchers focuses on STEM-based learning. For those who wonder what STEM is, It is a curriculum based on the idea of educating in four specific disciplines â€” science, technology, engineering and mathematics in an interdisciplinary and applied approach. It believes that science brings out the pure form of invention and technology enables innovation. HackBenchers takes you back to the old school questions which are still unanswered. And with the HackBenchers #4, we got an amazing opportunity to work on our project , which is the Golden Ratio App

## About The Project
This "Golden Ratio App" is an android mobile application which aims to depict the concept of Golden Ratio and enabling the users to understand what Golden Ratio is and its applications in Nature, Art, Architecture, Finance and many more.

## What We Aimed To Achieve
We aimed to build an android application with a appealing UI and fulfilling all the requirements of the hackathon theme. We planned to create Tabs to divide our application in three parts. The first tab will contain all the information about Golden Ratio and would be displayed in grids. The second tab will be contain myriads of examples and applications in video formats showing presence of Golden Ratio all around us. For the third tab we planned of building an online service where our android application will be asking the user for an image, which will be read by our python file and the server will be detecting the face using the OpenCV and Dlib library. Then it will be placing the golden ratio spiral on the face and determining how much the ratio of dimensions of face is close to golden ratio and displaying it to the user.

## What We Accomplished
We were successfully able to create the UI we planned. We made use of Grid Layout and Recycler View in our fragment layouts. We made use of external libraries -glide and ExoPlayer for our photos and videos. We stored our app data in Firebase Storage and Firebase Realtime Databse. We successfully wrote the code for continuous internet connectivity check by creating our own service within our app. We made a filter spinner for filtering the categories of examples. Using the OpenCV and Dlib libraries, we created our python file for calculating the ratio of the dimensions of the face and comparing it with golden ratio. We are using PIL for placing the golden ratio. The image processing for the service was built and but we faced some problems in hosting it into the cloud services.
